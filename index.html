            <p>Hello there! My name is Farah, and I'm currently immersed in a front-end developer bootcamp, pursuing my passion for web development. Alongside my studies, I also work as a customer support trainer at an EV charging company, where I help educate agents to assist customers with their queries and concerns.</p> 

            <p>Outside of work and coding, I find solace in the pages of books, as reading is a beloved hobby of mine. It allows me to explore new worlds, gain insights, and expand my knowledge in various subjects.</p> 
           <p> Additionally, I'm a big fan of swimming, as it not only keeps me fit but also provides a refreshing and calming experience.</p>
            <p>Overall, I am an enthusiastic learner and a dedicated professional, always seeking to enhance my skills in the world of web development. Whether it's coding, helping customers, or indulging in personal hobbies, I strive to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.</p>
